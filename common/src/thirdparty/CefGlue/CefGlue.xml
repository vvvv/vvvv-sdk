            Clips child windows relative to each other; that is, when a particular child window receives a WM_PAINT message, the WS_CLIPSIBLINGS style clips all other overlapping child windows out of the region of the child window to be updated.
            If WS_CLIPSIBLINGS is not specified and child windows overlap, it is possible, when drawing within the client area of a child window, to draw within the client area of a neighboring child window.

            The window is the first control of a group of controls. The group consists of this first control and all controls defined after it, up to the next control with the WS_GROUP style.
            The first control in each group usually has the WS_TABSTOP style so that the user can move from group to group. The user can subsequently change the keyboard focus from one control in the group to the next control in the group by using the direction keys.
            You can turn this style on and off to change dialog box navigation. To change this style after a window has been created, use the SetWindowLong function.

             Add an entry to the cross-origin access whitelist.
            
             The same-origin policy restricts how scripts hosted from different
             origins (scheme + domain + port) can communicate. By default, scripts
             can only access resources with the same origin. Scripts hosted on the
             HTTP and HTTPS schemes (but no other schemes) can use the "Access-
             Control-Allow-Origin" header to allow cross-origin requests. For
             example, https://source.example.com can make XMLHttpRequest requests
             on http://target.example.com if the http://target.example.com request
             returns an "Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://source.example.com"
             response header.
            
             Scripts in separate frames or iframes and hosted from the same
             protocol and domain suffix can execute cross-origin JavaScript if
             both pages set the document.domain value to the same domain suffix.
             For example, scheme://foo.example.com and scheme://bar.example.com
             can communicate using JavaScript if both domains set
             document.domain="example.com".
            
             This function is used to allow access to origins that would otherwise
             violate the same-origin policy. Scripts hosted underneath the fully
             qualified |source_origin| URL (like http://www.example.com) will be
             allowed access to all resources hosted on the specified
             |target_protocol| and |target_domain|. If |allow_target_subdomains|
             is true (1) access will also be allowed to all subdomains of the
             target domain.
            
             This function cannot be used to bypass the restrictions on local or
             display isolated schemes. See the comments on CefRegisterCustomScheme

             Register a custom scheme. This function should not be called for the
             built-in HTTP, HTTPS, FILE, FTP, ABOUT and DATA schemes.
            
             If |is_standard| is true (1) the scheme will be treated as a standard
             scheme. Standard schemes are subject to URL canonicalization and
             parsing rules as defined in the Common Internet Scheme Syntax RFC
             1738 Section 3.1 available at http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt
            
             In particular, the syntax for standard scheme URLs must be of the
             form: &lt;pre&gt;
              [scheme]://[username]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[url-path]
             &lt;/pre&gt; Standard scheme URLs must have a host component that is a
             fully qualified domain name as defined in Section 3.5 of RFC 1034
             [13] and Section 2.1 of RFC 1123. These URLs will be canonicalized to
             "scheme://host/path" in the simplest case and
             "scheme://username:password@host:port/path" in the most explicit
             case. For example, "scheme:host/path" and "scheme:///host/path" will
             both be canonicalized to "scheme://host/path". The origin of a
             standard scheme URL is the combination of scheme, host and port
             (i.e., "scheme://host:port" in the most explicit case).
            
             For non-standard scheme URLs only the "scheme:" component is parsed
             and canonicalized. The remainder of the URL will be passed to the
             handler as-is. For example, "scheme:///some%20text" will remain the
             same. Non-standard scheme URLs cannot be used as a target for form
             submission.
            
             If |is_local| is true (1) the scheme will be treated as local (i.e.,
             with the same security rules as those applied to "file" URLs). Normal
             pages cannot link to or access local URLs. Also, by default, local
             URLs can only perform XMLHttpRequest calls to the same URL (origin +
             path) that originated the request. To allow XMLHttpRequest calls from
             a local URL to other URLs with the same origin set the
             CefSettings.file_access_from_file_urls_allowed value to true (1). To
             allow XMLHttpRequest calls from a local URL to all origins set the
             CefSettings.universal_access_from_file_urls_allowed value to true
             (1).
            
             If |is_display_isolated| is true (1) the scheme will be treated as
             display- isolated. This means that pages cannot display these URLs
             unless they are from the same scheme. For example, pages in another
             origin cannot create iframes or hyperlinks to URLs with this scheme.
            
             This function may be called on any thread. It should only be called
             once per unique |scheme_name| value. If |scheme_name| is already
             registered or if an error occurs this function will return false (0).

            Register a scheme handler factory for the specified |scheme_name| and
            optional |domain_name|. An NULL |domain_name| value for a standard
            scheme will cause the factory to match all domain names. The
            |domain_name| value will be ignored for non-standard schemes. If
            |scheme_name| is a built-in scheme and no handler is returned by
            |factory| then the built-in scheme handler factory will be called. If
            |scheme_name| is a custom scheme the cef_register_custom_scheme()
            function should be called for that scheme. This function may be
            called multiple times to change or remove the factory that matches
            the specified |scheme_name| and optional |domain_name|. Returns false
            (0) if an error occurs. This function may be called on any thread.

The Help application displays a pop-up window that typically contains help for the child window.

             <summary>
             Register a custom scheme. This function should not be called for the
             built-in HTTP, HTTPS, FILE, FTP, ABOUT and DATA schemes.
            
             If |is_standard| is true (1) the scheme will be treated as a standard
             scheme. Standard schemes are subject to URL canonicalization and
             parsing rules as defined in the Common Internet Scheme Syntax RFC
             1738 Section 3.1 available at http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt
            
             In particular, the syntax for standard scheme URLs must be of the
             form: &lt;pre&gt;
              [scheme]://[username]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[url-path]
             &lt;/pre&gt; Standard scheme URLs must have a host component that is a
             fully qualified domain name as defined in Section 3.5 of RFC 1034
             [13] and Section 2.1 of RFC 1123. These URLs will be canonicalized to
             "scheme://host/path" in the simplest case and
             "scheme://username:password@host:port/path" in the most explicit
             case. For example, "scheme:host/path" and "scheme:///host/path" will
             both be canonicalized to "scheme://host/path".
            
             For non-standard scheme URLs only the "scheme:" component is parsed
             and canonicalized. The remainder of the URL will be passed to the
             handler as-is. For example, "scheme:///some%20text" will remain the
             same. Non-standard scheme URLs cannot be used as a target for form
             submission.
            
             If |is_local| is true (1) the scheme will be treated as local (i.e.,
             with the same security rules as those applied to "file" URLs). This
             means that normal pages cannot link to or access URLs of this scheme.
            
             If |is_display_isolated| is true (1) the scheme will be treated as
             display- isolated. This means that pages cannot display these URLs
             unless they are from the same scheme. For example, pages in another
             origin cannot create iframes or hyperlinks to URLs with this scheme.
            
             This function may be called on any thread. It should only be called
             once per unique |scheme_name| value. If |scheme_name| is already
             registered or if an error occurs this function will return false (0).

            Register a scheme handler factory for the specified |scheme_name| and optional |domain_name|.
            An NULL |domain_name| value for a standard scheme will cause the factory to match all domain names.
            The |domain_name| value will be ignored for non-standard schemes.
            If |scheme_name| is a built-in scheme and no handler is returned by |factory| then the built-in scheme handler factory will be called.
            If |scheme_name| is a custom scheme the cef_register_custom_scheme() function should be called for that scheme.
            This function may be called multiple times to change or remove the factory that matches the specified |scheme_name| and optional |domain_name|.
            Returns false (0) if an error occurs.

             Add an entry to the cross-origin access whitelist.
            
             The same-origin policy restricts how scripts hosted from different
             origins (scheme + domain) can communicate. By default, scripts can
             only access resources with the same origin. Scripts hosted on the
             HTTP and HTTPS schemes (but no other schemes) can use the "Access-
             Control-Allow-Origin" header to allow cross-origin requests. For
             example, https://source.example.com can make XMLHttpRequest requests
             on http://target.example.com if the http://target.example.com request
             returns an "Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://source.example.com"
             response header.
            
             Scripts in separate frames or iframes and hosted from the same
             protocol and domain suffix can execute cross-origin JavaScript if
             both pages set the document.domain value to the same domain suffix.
             For example, scheme://foo.example.com and scheme://bar.example.com
             can communicate using JavaScript if both domains set
             document.domain="example.com".
            
             This function is used to allow access to origins that would otherwise
             violate the same-origin policy. Scripts hosted underneath the fully
             qualified |source_origin| URL (like http://www.example.com) will be
             allowed access to all resources hosted on the specified
             |target_protocol| and |target_domain|. If |allow_target_subdomains|
             is true (1) access will also be allowed to all subdomains of the
             target domain. This function may be called on any thread. Returns
             false (0) if |source_origin| is invalid or the whitelist cannot be
             accessed.

            automatically decreases the global total by the appropriate amount on
            its destruction. |change_in_bytes| specifies the number of bytes to
