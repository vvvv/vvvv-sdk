This is an example of how to control an audio player app via OSC.

vvvv is talking via OSC to:

- ableton live (using max for live)
- max/msp
- pure data
- vvvv

Please start the Controller.v4p to have the controls over the different players.
These players can be placed on different machines, you just need to update the IP-address and the port number.
