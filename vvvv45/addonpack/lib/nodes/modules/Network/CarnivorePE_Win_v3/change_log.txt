Version 3, January 2011
+ rebuilt for Java 1.6

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.2.4
+ renamed the preferences file to ".carnivore_preferences.txt"

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.2.3, October 2007
+ Fixed "20 packet bug" whereby the unlimited packets/second setting was
really still capping output at 20 packets. now unlimited packets/second
is really unlimited.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.2.2, June 2007
+ Added support for [-playback filename] command line argument. This
will automagically start CarnivorePE playing back from a file. Example:
	java org/rsg/carnivore/CarnivorePE -playback Carnivore_Session_example_v2.2.1.ser
+ trying to reinstate Linux support -- seems to be working :) 

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.2.1, August 2006
+ increased pcap snap length to 65535, following recommendation on pcap
man page.
+ changed IPAddress.ip to an InetAddress.
+ added getHostName method to IPAddress.

Version 2.2, July 2006
+ moved java class files around so that there is a "core" engine
responsible for all the sniffing. The Processing and CPE versions now
simply act as clients for the core.
+ reorganized class files significantly. 
+ CarniPacket class is now called CarnivorePacket
+ the class accessed by Processing is now called CarnivoreP5 (not carnivore)
+ cleaned up format of output string: added milliseconds to packet
timestamp; changed ip/port separator to ":" which is more standard.
Clients *will* have to update their parsing routines.
+ reinstated console window
+ got ride of Mac authentication launcher app -- too complicated.
+ added ability to log packets to text file
+ added ability to record and playback capture sessions
+ dropped linux support (which was never really "supported" anyway due
to difficulty of testing and debugging.) adding linux support again in
the future should be easy however.

Version 2.1, Sept 2005
+ Added platform specific launcher apps to exec the `java -jar cpe.jar` command
+ Mac launcher app authenticates and launches jvm as root. (this avoids having to 
chmod devices manually)

Version 2, September 2005
+ ported to Java (to resolve VB/PacketX/Winpcap problems in the windows version)
+ consolidated and reorganized GUI
+ removed splash screen
+ removed debug window
+ removed collapse/expand tab functionality in GUI 

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.4.0
+ ported application from windows
+ sniffer defaults to whatever network adapter is in use (either en1 or en0)

+ integrated new packet header parsing features from PacketX version 1.2.2
+ will now accept multiple clients, each with own channel

Version 1.3.1
+ carnivore channel now skips first 54 bytes to increase performance
+ also, packets are only parsed if the client is actually requesting them
