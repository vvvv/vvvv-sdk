LibVLC and LibVlcCore are subject to the LGPLv2.1+ license. See also http://www.videolan.org

I used (and added a few things to) some code from nVLC by Smitha Vijayan, which is a .net wrapper for LibVLC.
I actually don't use his wrapper classes, but only the files that contain the 'DllImport' statements, 
and the mapping of some structs to c# equivalents. 
All of the relevant files can be found in the /LibVLCWrapper folder.

After contacting the author, he stated that nVLC can be used with any license that LibVLC comes with.
