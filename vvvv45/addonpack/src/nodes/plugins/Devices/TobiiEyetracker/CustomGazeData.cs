        /* Eye Position (3D): 
         * The eye position is provided for the left and right eye individually and describes the position of the eyeball in
         * 3D space. Three floating point values are used to describe the x, y and z coordinate respectively. The position is
         * described in the UCS coordinate system.
         * 
         * Relative Eye Position (3D)
         * The relative eye position is provided for the left and right eye individually and gives the relative position of the 
         * eyeball in the headbox volume as three normalized coordinates. This data can be used to visualize the position
         * of the eyes similar to how it is done in the Tobii track status control. This is mainly a tool to help the user
         * position himself/herself in front of the tracker.
         * 
         * Gaze Point (3D):
         * The gaze point is provided for the left and right eye individually and describes the position of the intersection 
         * between the line originating from the eye position point with the same direction as the gaze vector and the 
         * calibration plane.
         * The gaze vector can be computed by substracting the 3D gaze point and the 3D eye position and normalizing 
         * the resulting vector.
         * 
         * Relative Gaze Point (2D):
         * The relative gaze point is provided for the left and right eye individually and corresponds to the two
         * dimensional position of the gaze point within the calibration plane. The coordinates are normalized to [0,1]
         * with the point (0,0) in the upper left corner from the users point of view. The x-coordinate increases to the
         * right and the y-coordinate increases towards the bottom of the screen.
         * 
         * Validity Code:
         * The validity code is an estimate of how certain the eye tracker is that the data given for an eye really originates
         * from that eye. When the tracker finds two eyes in the camera image, identifying which one is the left and
         * which one is the right eye is very straightforward as well as when no eyes are found at all. The most
         * challenging case is when the tracker only finds one eye in the camera image. When that happens, the image
         * processing algorithms try to deduce if the eye in question is the left or the right one. This is done by referring
         * to previous eye positions, the position in the camera sensor and certain image features. The validity codes
         * describe the outcome of this deduction.
         * The validity codes can be used to filter out data that is most likely incorrect. Normally it is recommended that
         * all samples with validity code 2 or higher are removed or ignored.
