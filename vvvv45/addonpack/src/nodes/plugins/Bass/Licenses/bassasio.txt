NOTE: To run the example EXEs, first you will have to copy BASSASIO.DLL into
      the same directory as them. You will also need BASS.DLL, which can be
      download from the BASS website.

NOTE: To build the examples, you will need to copy the BASS API into the
      same directory as the BASSASIO API.


What's the point?
=================
BASSASIO is basically a wrapper for ASIO drivers, with the addition of channel
joining, format conversion and resampling.


Requirements
============
BASSASIO requires a soundcard with ASIO drivers installed. It also makes use
of SSE and 3DNow optimizations, but is fully functional without them.

The BASS library is not required by BASSASIO, but BASS can of course be used
for decoding purposes, to apply DSP/FX, etc...


Using BASSASIO
==============
C/C++, Visual Basic and Delphi APIs are provided, to use BASSASIO with another
language you'll first have to convert the header file. Or, you could use
LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress.

There is no guarantee that all future BASSASIO versions will be compatible
with all previous versions, so your program should use BASS_ASIO_GetVersion
to check the version that is loaded. This also means that you should
put BASSASIO.DLL in the same directory as your program (not just somewhere
in the path), to avoid the possibility of a wrong version being loaded.

If you are updating your software from a previous BASSASIO version, then
you should check the "History" section (below), to see if any of the
functions that you are using have been affected by a change.

To use BASSASIO with Borland C++ Builder, you'll first have to create a
Borland C++ Builder import library for it. This is done by using the
IMPLIB tool that comes with Borland C++ Builder. Simply execute this:

	IMPLIB BASSASIOBCB.LIB BASSASIO.DLL

... and then use BASSASIOBCB.LIB in your projects to import BASSASIO.

To use BASSASIO with LCC-Win32, you'll first have to create a compatible
import library for it. This is done by using the PEDUMP and BUILDLIB
tools that come with LCC-Win32. Run these 2 commands:

	PEDUMP /EXP BASSASIO.LIB > BASSASIOLCC.EXP
	BUILDLIB BASSASIOLCC.EXP BASSASIOLCC.LIB

... and then use BASSASIOLCC.LIB in your projects to import BASSASIO.

For the BASSASIO functions that return strings (char*), VB users should use
the VBStrFromAnsiPtr function to convert the returned pointer into a VB
string.

for free. If you wish to use BASSASIO in commercial products, then please

Commercial licensing
--------------------
BASSASIO is available for use in your commercial products. The licence
types available are as follows:

SHAREWARE: Allows the usage of BASSASIO in an unlimited number of your
shareware products, which must sell for no more than 40 Euros each.
If you are an individual (not a corporation) making and selling your
own software (and its price is within the limit), this is the licence
for you.

SINGLE COMMERCIAL: Allows the usage of BASSASIO in a single commercial
product.

UNLIMITED COMMERCIAL: Allows the usage of BASSASIO in an unlimited number
of your commercial products. This licence is on a per site basis. So
if your company has two sites that use BASSASIO, then two licences are
required.

Please note the products must be end-user products, eg. not components
used by other products. 

These licences only cover your own software, not the publishing of
other's software. If you publish other's software, its developers (or
the software itself) will need to be licensed to use BASSASIO.

In all cases there are no royalties to pay, and you can use future BASSASIO
updates without further cost. One licence covers one person or entity and
is not transferable.

These licences do not allow reselling/sublicensing of BASSASIO. For example,
if a product is a development system, the users of said product are not
licensed to use BASSASIO in their productions; they will need their own
licences.

If the standard licences do not meet your requirements, or if you have
any questions, please get in touch (email: bass@un4seen.com).
