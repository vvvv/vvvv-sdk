Version 0.5.2
-Added threaded beat scanner node.
-Added FFT Node for non real time retrieval.
-Small bug fixes.
-Added VST Effect DSP Node.


Version 0.5
-Added base encoder node.
-Added Ogg, WMA, WAV encoder nodes.
-Added IceCast broadcast node (Works with Ogg as Lame doesn't work with 32bit floating point data).
-Added lot of DSP.
-RMS Node now returns the normalized float value (between 0 and 1), instead of decibels version.
-Individual access to channels on the AudioIn asio.
-Merged Asio and Bass in the same library.


Version 0.4

New Features:
-New Mixer Node has config pin for inputs, and deals with matrix level too.
-Merged both FileStream (Asio and Bass) into a single filestream.
-Loads of refresh bugs
-AudioOut for both Asio and WDM
-Added Dynamic Channel, so you can feed whatever you want in it :)
-Added Beat detector node.
-Added WaveForm gui node

Bug Fixes:
-Fixed loop refresh issue
-Fixed filename and mono pin refresh issue (any of those reset the track).
-Data Nodes (ChannelData,FFT,RMS) detect if we conntect to a mixer for better performances.
-Lot of Pin renaming to be consistent between nodes

Version 0.3.1

Bug Fixes
-Fixed Mixer which had wrong sample rate (Temporary fix, need further update)

New Node(s)
SetMixerLevel
-Allow Matrix Level on Mixer, update each channel the way you want :)

Version 0.3

Updated Nodes:

FileStream
-Added Loop Input pin
-Added Play Input Pin
-Changing the Mono Input Pin now resets the channel
-Added a Channel count Output Pin (1: Mono, 2: Stereo...)

AudioOut
-The AudioOut channel checks the play status of a FileStream to decide if it streams it or not.

New Node(s):

Mixer
-Added new Mixer Node, so we can play back multiple files on same channel.
