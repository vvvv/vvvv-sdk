  This file controls the conversion process when opening patches.
    
  The author of the pack enters name changes and default value changes for each new version of the pack.

  ========================================================================================================
	
  For the author of the pack:	
  
  Pack versions must follow the pattern MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH with major, minor and patch being integer numbers 
  smaller than 1000000.    
  <PATCH version="0.1.0"> includes all changes for that new version of the pack.  
  You may enter planned name and default value changes upfront. The actual pack version is then defined by 
  the version.info file.
  Conversion only happens when the version specified in the version.info doesn't match the pack info stored 
  in the users patch.
  If there is no pack info in the users' patch, the patch is treated as if it was stored with 
  version 0.0.0 of this pack loaded.
  In rare cases you might want to convert a patch back to an older version of your pack. Try to put your newest 
  diffff.xml into the old pack (old dlls, old version.info). 
  Users will only be asked to try back conversion if 
    a) the their patch was stored with a newer version than the loaded pack
	b) there are some rules in the diffff that show how to convert back from that newer version (new diffff in old pack!!)
	c) some nodes of the users' patch would actually be affected by the back conversion
  Note that we don't have back conversion of default values of pins.	
      
  * add a node tag within the patch tag for the node you want to be converted
      <NODE old="I (Spread)">
      </NODE>   
      
  * add attribute "new" if you want to change the node name
      new="J (Value)"
      
  * add a pin tag within the node tag if you want to change the pin interface
      <PIN old="Output"> </PIN>
      
  * add attribute "new" if you want to change the pin name
      new="Integers"
      
  * add attribute "olddefault" if you want to change the default value of the pin. 
    specify the old default value.
      olddefault="3" 

  * you may use <PATCH version="current">, which then refers to the version entered in the version.info file.
